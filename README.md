# Introduction to RAY

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that provides an introduction to using Ray for distributed computing in Python. The notebook demonstrates how to load data, train models, and tune hyperparameters using Ray.

## Repository Contents

- `Introduction_to_Ray.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook that covers the basics of Ray, including setup, usage, and examples.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this experiment, you will be able to:

- Load the data into RayDMatrix
- Train the XGBoost Ray model and save it
- Tune the hyperparameters using Ray Tune

## Getting Started

To get started with the notebook, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Necessary Python packages (listed in the `requirements.txt` file)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Praveen76/Introduction-to-RAY.git
    cd Introduction-to-RAY
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    or

    ```sh
    jupyter lab
    ```

2. Open the notebook `Introduction_to_Ray.ipynb`.

3. Follow the instructions and run the cells in the notebook to learn about and use Ray for distributed computing and machine learning.
